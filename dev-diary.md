## Day 0
Dear diary, I've spent some time looking for the place to start. I must say that those react starters are great, but a little to complicated. Working on the established stack is way easier and allows to focus on more on quality of the particular features.

I've finally found the one that seems to be fine.

New things to learn:
- Redux, kinda different than Fluxible
- React Router, similar but different
- Github auth, it seems I'm the busy developer they mention there: https://gist.github.com/technoweenie/419219

Final thoughts of the day: The test runner needs to be changed, right now there is no much use of it. Redux is not that complicated. React Router works way different than the one I know.

## Day 1
Dear diary, I've managed to create a new site that is available for the github auth api. Placing 127.0.0.1 as my app url works well enough for github to register an app. I've displayed the data that comes from the url. Let's call it a success.
